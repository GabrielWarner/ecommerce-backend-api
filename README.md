# Ecommerce Backend



## Description
In this application I built a backend database that holds a stores products that are under seperate categories. Each product has an associated tag name that is linked with a foreign key within sequelize. This application is using the dotenv npm package to pass in environment variables along with a combination of Express, MySQL2 and Sequelize to setup the server and database.
